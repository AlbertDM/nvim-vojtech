# nvim-vojtech
This is my personal repo for storing and synchronizing my nvim configurations.
Some features you will find in it:
* Molokai Colors
* C/C++, Python, Rust, Bash, Git, Markdown, Bitbake focused plugins
* COC
* FZF
* Polyglot
...


I expect to improve the expalantions of how I use the plugins and the commands I use the most.
